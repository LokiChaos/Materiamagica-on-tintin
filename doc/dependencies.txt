Requirements you will likely have to install yourself:
	tintin++ 2.00.9 or newer
	tmux 1.8 or newer

For installing tintin, consult:
	http://tintin.sourceforge.net/install.php

For installing tmux, consult:
	http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
	Download the .tar.bz via the download link, and install instructions are
	in the README.

These are standard on most *nix systems:
	curl
	awk (preferably GNU awk, but BSD awks should be fine)
	sed (preferable GNU sed, but BSD seds should be fine)
	tail (ideally one that support inotify or equivilent)
	bash (should work with any sh compatable shell)
	perl

These should all already be installed.  If you are missing these, I suggest
searching "installing $package on $distro".

I DO NOT SUPPORT TinTin++ UNDER MS WINDOWS EITHER VIA THE WinTin++ or TinTin++
UNDER CYGWIN OPTIONS.  I suggest running a minimal virtual machine with a
lightweight X-less Linux install and run tintin++ in that and connect via
puTTY.
