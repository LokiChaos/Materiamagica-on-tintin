This is still under heavy development, but is stable and has no known major bugs.

As I have more time, I will update and expand the documentation.  If you are having trouble you can contact me in-game, message me on the MM website, or create an issue here.

See doc/dependencies.txt for what you will need to install.

More detailed instructions on installation will come later, and possibly a Makefile installer.
