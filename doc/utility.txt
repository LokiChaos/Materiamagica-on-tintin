Several basic functions and subroutines have been defined for both internal
use and for you to use in your own custom scripts.  They are mostly defined
in core/utility.tt and core/utility/*.tt  This file documents their usage
and provides examples.  If you examine the code, most of these are quite
simple, often only one or two lines, but by wrapping them in an alias or a
function it gives them context that makes understanding the code easier.
